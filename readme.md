Predicting cruise ship weight is crucial for ship design, with significant implications for the economic viability of cruise ship ventures. 
The weight affects fuel consumption, stability, and construction costs. 
Efficient weight estimation helps companies balance safety and cost-effectiveness. 
Accurate weight predictions optimize designs, ensuring long-term success and competitiveness in the cruise ship industry.  

Predictive machine learning models are viable tools for weight estimation.
In this project, we will solely rely on the ship's physical dimensions, as they are the most relevant factors for the weight. 
Ships with larger dimensions invariably tend to weight more, and there exists a direct correlation between ship size and weight.
