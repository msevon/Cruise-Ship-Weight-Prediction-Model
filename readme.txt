Predicting cruise ship weight is a vital undertaking in ship design, and it carries significant implications for the economic viability of cruise ship ventures. The weight of a cruise ship affects numerous aspects of its operation. Utilizing regressive predictive models to estimate the weight allows cruise companies to strike a balance between safety and performance standards and economic viability. 

Predictive machine learning models are viable tools for weight estimation.In this project, we will solely rely on the ship's physical dimensions, as they are the most relevant factors for the weight. Ships with larger dimensions invariably tend to weight more, and there exists a direct correlation between ship size and weight.
